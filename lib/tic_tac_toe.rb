def full?(board)  ###### this method works, but this can be written more clearly <<<----
  board.all? do |positions|
    #puts "The #{board.length} position is #{positions}"

  if positions == " "
    puts "The board is NOT full, there are some empty spaces."
  #if board.all? { |obj| obj }

  elsif (positions == "X") || (positions == "O")
  #elsif board.all?
    puts "The board is full!"
    true
    end # end if...else statement
  end # end for each loop
end # end full? method

#####another way to do it, much simpler... this is how a Learn.co instructor said it could be done:
# def full?(board)
#   board.all?{|token| token == "X" || token == "O"}
# end



def draw?(board)
  if !won?(board) && !full?(board) # if not won and board is not full
    puts "The board is not full yet, so it can't be a draw."
    false # it is NOT a draw
  elsif !won?(board) && full?(board) # if not won and full board
    puts "The game is a draw. No one wins."
    true # it is a draw
  end # end if statement
end # end method


def over?(board)
  if draw?(board)
    puts "Cats Game!"
    true
  elsif won?(board)
    winner(board) # call winner(board) method to congratulate X or O
    true
  else
    puts "The game is not over yet."
    false
  end # end if...elsif..else statement
end # end method



##another way to do winner(board), by copying won?(board):::
#def winner(board) # same as won?(board) method #### <<<<-------- better way to do this???

def winner(board)
  if won?board
    if board[won?(board)[0]] == "X"
      puts "Congratulations X!"
      return "X"
    elsif board[won?(board)[0]] == "O"
      puts "Congratulations O!"
      return "O"
    end # end if..else statement
  else !won?(board)
    nil ###this nil is returned outside the if..elsif statement, which is inside the if won?board statement
  end # end if won?board statement
end # end method

####### super small version::::::::
# def winner(board)
#   if won?(board)
#     puts "#{board[won?(board)[0]]} is the winner"
#     return board[won?(board)[0]]
#   end
# end



#with until loop:::
def play(board) #play method initiates a simple loop and calls #turn
  until over?(board)
    turn(board) #calls turn method
  end #end until over?(board) loop
end #end play(board) method



# def play(board)
#   # turn(board)
#   # if over?(board) ###== true
#   #   # if the game is over after that last move...
#   #   over?(board) #...then run the over?(board) method, to do whatever happens if the game is over (win, lose, or draw)
#   # end #end if over?(board) statement
# end #end method
